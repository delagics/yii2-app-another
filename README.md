Yii 2 Another Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front, back, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

## What's inside:

- Improved project structure (see [Directory structure](#directory-structure));
- Language management through URLs with help of [codemix/yii2-localeurls](https://github.com/codemix/yii2-localeurls);
- Flexible user registration and authentication module ([dektrium/yii2-user](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-user));
- RBAC management module ([dektrium/yii2-rbac](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-rbac));
- `yii init` console command which simplifies project preparation;
- [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) support, for easier project configuration, with Laravel like environment variable getter: `env('YII_ENV', 'dev')`;

> **Note**: tests are currently not included.

## Requirements

The minimum requirement by this project template is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.
Recommended is PHP 7.

## Installation

### Install using `composer`

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), follow the instructions in the
[Installing Yii](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/guide/start-installation.md#installing-via-composer) section of the definitive guide to install it.

With Composer installed, you can then install the application using the following commands:

    composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.2"
    composer create-project --prefer-dist delagics/yii2-app-another another.dev

The first command installs the [composer asset plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/)
which allows managing bower and npm package dependencies through Composer. You only need to run this command
once for all. The second command installs the _another_ application in a directory named `another.dev`.
You can choose a different directory name if you want.

Then follow the instructions given in the [Preparing application](#preparing-application) section.

### Install with `git`

Clone repository as a web root.
```
git clone git@github.com:delagics/yii2-app-another.git another.dev
```

> Directory named `another.dev` is your Web root.

Then install the [composer asset plugin](https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/),
go to the web root folder in a console terminal and run `composer install`:

```
composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.2"

cd /var/www/another.dev
composer install
```

Then follow the instructions given in the [Preparing application](#preparing-application) section.

## Preparing application

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1.  Create a new database.

2.  Open a console terminal in the root directory of your project and execute the `php yii init/environment && php yii init/initialize` command,
and follow the steps of the script.

When switching to production environment, execute `php yii init/env` and choose `PROD` environment.

```
php yii init/env
```

3. Set document roots of your web server:

   - for `/path/to/another.dev/public/` and using the URL `http://another.dev/`

   For **nginx** it could be the following:

```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        charset utf-8;
        client_max_body_size 128M;
        root /var/www/another.dev/public;
        server_name another.dev www.another.dev;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;
        # access_log /var/www/another.dev/logs/access_log.txt;
        # error_log /var/www/another.dev/logs/error_log.txt error;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
        }
        location /admin {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /admin/index.php?$args;
        }
        location ~ \.php$ {
            #NOTE: You should have "cgi.fix_pathinfo = 0;" in php.ini
            try_files $uri =404;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
        location /storage {
            # Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the storage directory
            location ~ \.php$ {
                deny all;
            }
            location ~* ^/.+\.(ogg|ogv|svg|svgz|eot|otf|woff|mp4|ttf|rss|atom|jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|zip|tgz|gz|rar|bz2|doc|xls|exe|ppt|tar|mid|midi|wav|bmp|rtf)$ {
                expires max;
                add_header Cache-Control public;
                log_not_found off;
                access_log off;
            }
        }
        # Deny all attempts to access hidden files and folders such as .git, .htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store.
        location ~ /\. {
            deny all;
        }
        location = /favicon.ico {
            log_not_found off;
            access_log off;
        }
        location = /robots.txt {
            allow all;
            log_not_found off;
            access_log off;
        }
    }
```

4. Change the hosts file to point the domain to your server.

   - Windows: `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
   - Linux: `/etc/hosts`

   Add the following lines:

   ```
   127.0.0.1   another.dev
   ```

To login into the application, use your username and password created when running `php yii init/up` command, or sing up with new credentials.

php yii message app/front/messages/config.php
